## Caffeine ##
This project collects data from nutrition facts of major cafes and restaurants - information on caffeine content. Then I try to display the data in a more reader-facing way.
The visualization now display the caffeine content in several popular energy drinks, and show how many cups of coffee it equivalent to.

Next Step:
1. Finish the second visualization, which is a vending machine where readers can select drinks they want and calculate the amount of caffeine
2. Try to intergrate all the visualization in one page (ideally svelte)
3. Combine the visualization with the story.
